#MyQGarageController

## Attempting to reverse engineer the Liftmaster/Chamberlain API

So far I am able to aunthenticate against the API and get a list of controllers (hubs, openers, etc.) from the API.
The next step is to send commands.

Currently, username and password are defined in constants.  Need to add a user profile screen and workflow.
